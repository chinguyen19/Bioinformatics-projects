# Computational Drug Discovery for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors

## Project Overview
**Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** plays a crucial role in the breakdown of acetylcholine in the nervous system. Inhibition of AChE is a known therapeutic target for managing symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Identifying potential AChE inhibitors through computational models provides an efficient way to screen compounds and accelerate drug discovery.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Retrieve bioactivity data related to AChE from the ChEMBL database.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and transform chemical data to be model-ready.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to classify compounds based on their bioactivity (active or inactive) against AChE.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
- **Result Interpretation**: Identify potential lead compounds for further experimental validation.

## Dataset

- **Data Source**: ChEMBL database
- **Target Protein**: Acetylcholinesterase (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL220)
- **Bioactivity Data**: Compounds with bioactivity data classified as active, inactive, or intermediate.
